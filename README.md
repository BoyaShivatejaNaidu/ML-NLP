Problems Overview

🧮 Problem 1: 2D NumPy Array Operations
Create a 5×4 array with random integers.
Extract anti-diagonal elements.
Compute row-wise max values.
Filter elements ≤ mean.
Define a function to traverse array boundaries clockwise.

📊 Problem 2: 1D NumPy Array Operations
Generate 20 random floats.
Round values to 2 decimals.
Compute min, max, median.
Square elements < 5.
Define a function to sort array in alternating smallest-largest order.

📝 Problem 3: Student Grades (Pandas)
Each of 10 students is graded in 10 subjects.
Compute total, scaled score (out of 100), and assign grades (A–F).
Sort students by scaled score.
Compute subject-wise averages.
Filter students with grade A or B.

💬 Problem 4: Sentiment Analysis (Naive Bayes)

Vectorize using CountVectorizer (max 500 features, stop word removal).
Train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
Print test accuracy.
Implement a function to predict sentiment for a new review.

🧠 Problem 5: Product Feedback Classification (Logistic Regression)
Create 100 product reviews (good/bad).
Vectorize using TfidfVectorizer (max 1000 features, lowercase, stop word removal).
Train a Logistic Regression classifier.
